== Installing these settings

I highly recommend you fork this so my constant tweaks don't mess up your config.

Once you have your repo setup do the following

  cd cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages

If you already have a User directory here you should move or rename it.

  git clone URL-of-your-repo User

Quit and restart Sublime Text 2
